With over 55 combined years of experience in the hospitality industry, Rob and Dorothee Newcombe have welcomed guests from the far stretches of the globe into their home for nearly 30 years. Having originally met in Leysin, Switzerland, Rob and Dorothee first nurtured their mutual appreciation for good food, good friends, and good times in the small town of West Brome, Quebec.</p><p> The Loft Acres, as it was called, was established on an old dairy farm and catered to horseback riders in the summer and suited locals and visitors alike as an apr&egrave;s ski destination in the winter. It was not uncommon to find Rob carving meat for Sunday buffets or tending to whole pig roasts by the barn as Dorothee maintained smooth service in the dining room and various bars.  In 1993, nearly 15 years after The Loft's opening, they then chose to make the move to Lincolnville Beach. It's here, with their two children Kirk and Jodi, where they have since resided.

<p>
What was originally intended as an opportunity for the family to scale down the size of their operation, the Whale's Tooth soon grew to include the Beach House Suites and now more recently the Beach Cottage Inn. Come join them as they share a taste of Maine with you in one of the finest quintessential Midcoast towns. See you soon!</p>

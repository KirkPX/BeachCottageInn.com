        </h1> 

<a href="images/harbor-sailboats-lobster-waterfront.jpg" rel="lightbox" title=""><img src="images/oceanfront-beach-house-suites-rentals.png" alt="On the oceanfront you'll be able to watch lobster and sailboast plying the ocean waters" id="image-column" border="0"/></a>
<p id="p-column">Maine offers some of the most picturesque coastline in New England. The villages and small communities of the Midcoast shelter the largest lobster fishing fleet in the world. Penobscot Bay and its numerous islands is a haven for recreational boating and has been a destination for the sailing community looking for safe waters and unprecedented scenery.</p>

<p>Lincolnville is one of the villages geographically placed at "The Heart of The Maine Coast”. With our beautiful sand beach, great food, plenty of accommodation and lots to do, our 'small town with a big heart' is your ideal vacation destination. </p>

<p>Just six miles south of Lincolnville Beach is the town of Camden, a focal point of Midcoast Maine. Its gorgeous views overlooking the harbor and Windjammer fleet make it a major tourist destination. The towns surrounding Camden and Lincolnville, Belfast to the north and Rockland to the south, have their own charms and summer activities that collectively makes our Midcoast a 'must-see' place to visit.</p>

<p>Our oceanfront cottage rentals, Beach Cottage Inn and Maine Beach House Suites, offer panoramic sea views and are walking distance to the shops and restaurants of the village of Lincolnville Beach. Taking a sailing day-trip on a Windjammer, or learning to kayak or sail is part of the summer fun. Visit our local museums, art galleries and antique shops, attend wine tastings, weekend festivals and summer concerts, or go hiking in the Camden Hills State Park. You can even take a day trip to island of Isleboro by riding the ferry from our town's pier.</p>

<p>Visit us in the fall and winter and enjoy the Harvest Festival at the Cellardoor Winery, the Pop!Tech conference, and our world famous U.S. National Toboggan Championships.</p>

<p>As you can see, the ongoing activities and ambiance is unparalleled in our area where “The Mountains Meet The Sea”! Visit our 'Things To Do' tab for a complete list of dates and activities, and to further explore the area's assets while planning your trip, visit the Camden Rockport Lincolnville Chamber of Commerce, <a href="http://www.visitcamden.com" target="_blank">www.visitcamden.com</a>.

<p>We would be pleased to have you come visit us on the water, at the <strong>Beach Cottage Inn</strong>, <strong>Maine Beach House Suites</strong> and <strong>The Whale’s Tooth Pub &amp; Restaurant</strong> in Lincolnville Beach.</p>
<p>You have to visit to really understand this special part of the world.  We did, and we are still here - fifteen years later.</p>

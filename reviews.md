Quaint is the word that comes to mind. We were in Maine in the off-season, when much was closed for the winter, so the focus was on a restful vacation. The Beach Cottage Inn is located in a scenic spot -- our balcony looked out over Penobscot Bay, and it was warm enough a few days to sit out. Unfortunately, our host was out-of-town for a family emergency, but we didn't lack for anything since Rob, a neighbor, filled-in and made sure our stay was nice. If you are looking for a modern hotel, go elsewhere, but if you are looking for a place that feels homey and comfortable, I would recommend the Beach Cottage Inn.

Location to beach and the few local stores couldn’t be better. Parking is limited and not the easiest to get out of but seems to work out of but was very convenient to my room.

The Beach Cottage Inn was the perfect spot in Maine, away from all the crowds in a quaint little town with a beach and a couple of restaurants in walking distance. Just a short trip to Camden Harbor which is a beautiful little town with restaurants and a marina you can easily go out on boat ride. Bar Harbor was about 1 1/2 hr drive but it was a nice ride. The Beach Cottage Inn was clean and had all the comforts of home including a very comfortable bed. Dorothee was a great host with great tips of places to go. We enjoyed our stay very much and would highly recommend.

We choose this location for it's excellent reviews and affordability compared to Camden lodging only a few miles away. We would gladly stay, again. The owner and staff were very obliging. Our room, the Appledore, had a wonderful layout: bedroom with comfortable king bed, a kitchette room, & separate room for watching TV or computing. We highly recommend The Waterfront Restaurant in Camden for a lobster dinner. It was very affordable & offered a great view of the harbor, but go early for parking and a shorter wait. The Schooner Appledore is another favorite offering a 2-hour sailing trip for $60.

Very nice little inn within easy walking distance of the best of Lincolnville - the beach, the pizza place and Dot's. The proprietor was at a meeting but gave me good directions when I called the number she left. My room was spacious and unique with lots of good touches. Better than average in room coffee and real mugs, a freezer on the fridge and a sort of living room area all were appreciated. I really loved it and will definitely return.

We had a lovely room with a nice outdoor terrace area - all very clean and comfortable. The Inn is in a fabulous location overlooking the beach and near to the ferry. It is also next door to the Whale Tooth pub which did great evening meals. The hostess recommended Dot's diner for breakfast, a 2-minute drive up the road and it was excellent. Lincolnville is a great location for visiting various places, including Acadia National Park and Fort Knox and the bridge observatory, highly recommend a visit to those.

Parking right next to the room. I've taken overnight stays from airbnb that were much more expensive and far less comfortable.

The driveway was a little difficult to find in the dark. The room was nicely decorated but was very very small. Reminded me of camping in an RV. For the price paid, there are many other nicer places in this area. Would personally not recommend, especially for a couple looking to get away.

Sally was very nice at checkin and gave us tips on the area. Our room is spacious. Bathroom was small but private. The bed was my biggest complaint, very uncomfortable and the bedposts are foot and ankle biters! We were very close to the very busy road so my suggestion is to close the interior doors between the sitting area and bedroom and it will be alot quiter for sleeping, otherwise we enjoyed our stay.

The Loft
As soon as we pulled in we were given a friendly welcome and shown our clean, small room, “The Loft”. The view of the sunrise over the water was nice in the early morning, though the water is more easily seen, from some nice places to sit outdoors, The restaurant next door is a convenience and also offers outdoor seating. The good location, cleanliness, and friendly atmosphere were great. We had a lovely stay.

Loved we could walk out onto the beach each morning and breathe the ocean air, hear the dingy ring at night. So peaceful. Thank you.

This was a perfect location to explore maine. It's a nice small town with a nearby Beach and a few restaurants and coffee shops spend some time in, but really a small town with that small town feel that was perfect for the stay. You are right in between Acadia National Park and Portland which was great for our trip. Staff was friendly and the room was perfect I highly recommend it.

Dorothea met us when we arrived, and showed us our room, the Puffin's Nest. As advertised, the room was small, but the shared porch was nice sized and had lovely time. Perfect location for quiet time.View of water, the beach and ferry made for a lovely stay.

Great choice. Don’t hesitate.
We stayed in the crow’s nest and had a beautiful ocean view. The sunrises and sunsets were spectacular. There’s a few nice restaurants in walking distance. The inn Keeper was kind and easy going. Everyone loved it from the guest book comments. It was a great choice and I’d stay in this room again!

Lofty experience
Check in was not a problem. We were told due to the covid that for the three night stay we would not get clean sheets or towels unless we asked for them. The room was a loft but a lot smaller than we expected for the price. very small bathroom and a sloped ceiling that even my 5'2" wife hit her head on. No real space to put the suitcase even though a luggage rack was provided. Very small sink - Room was clean and relatively new which was a plus. The ocean overlook also included a nice view of the back of the adjoining restaurant which included the dumpsters (not really pleasant). The inn offered a restaurant which seemed to cater more to locals and friends more than the guests. Did not get a warm feeling from the female owner as she never checked on our satisfaction over the three day stay.

We had an overall very pleasant stay. Staff was very friendly and happy to host us. The kitchenette was great & had everything we needed (dishes, glasses, cookware, utensils). It's nice being able to walk next door to the restaurant & beach & it's also just a short drive to the state park and downtown Camden. We wanted to relax in the evenings and unfortunately the couch in the living area was very uncomfortable and really needs to be replaced. Overall though, definitely not a bad place to stay.

Cozy Nights
We stayed in the Puffins Nest room of Beach Cottage Inn. I expect the Puffins Nest room is smallest guest room in the cottage house and we were delighted to stay there. Even though a small room, it was cozy and met our needs as place to stay for two nights in the area of Maine coastline that we were exploring. The Beach Cottage Inn is directly on the waterfront which provided wonderful morning views of the water. All water-front restaurants in Lincolnville are in easy walking distance of Beach Cottage Inn.

A Pleasant Experience
We had an enjoyable visit to Camden and Lincolnville this past weekend. The Inn is part of the Whales Tooth Restaurant and is a short 10-15 minute ride from Camden. We stayed in "The Loft" room which is very tight but functional for two people. If we were staying more than three nights, I would want to stay in a larger unit (unfortunately, none were available at the time). Our hosts, Rob and Deborah, were very nice and very willing to help in any way that they could. Their restaurant served very nice, satisfying meals. In addition, the Inn is on the water with great views. A good, affordable place to stay with a good restaurant and only a few minutes from Camden. Worth a visit!

Missed the view
I was disappointed that the only view I had was of the main highway right outside my room and no opportunity to open windows for the sea air, all windows faced public places. The room was ok but the bed was uncomfortable. Needs an upgrade. The room was very well stocked with coffee, tea etc and glassware and the staff was friendly. Easy to park too. And walking distance to restaurants and stores.

BEACH COTTAGE
The cottage was indeed right adjacent to Lincolnville Beach, a very nice small resort area. The facility was quiet, well kept and had ample parking. The room I stayed in was the Puffin's Nest. Be aware that it was quite small even for one guest and would be very tight with two. There simply was not enough flat space to put the ordinary traveler's items in either the bedroom or the bathroom. There as no table or bureau only two small nightstands, and no closet, but there was a coat rack. Final warning....the shower stall floor surface is very slippery. After one slip-up I used the shower only minimally and with care. The place itself is just fine but do investigate your room options to be sure conditions are what you need.

Great for a stopover
My wife and I stayed one night enroute to our destination. The innkeeper was very friendly and made the stay very enjoyable. The inn is right on the ocean. The adjacent restaurant was quite busy the day we stayed, which indicated it is a popular place to eat.
